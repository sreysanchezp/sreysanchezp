Hi there!

my name is Santiago and I am a graduate Economics Student at the University of Mannheim. I have focused in econometrics during my studies and have decided to apply
what I have learned to my hobbies: the statistical modelling sports, gambling and finance. The idea is to publish the codes of my personal project. One never stops learning, so now I am digesting topics in copula and stochastic volatility.

Any feedback is welcome!
