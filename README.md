Hi there!

my name is Santiago and I am a graduate Economics Student at the University of Mannheim. I have focused in econometrics during my studies and have decided to apply
what I have learned to my hobbies: the statistical modelling sports and gambling. The idea is to publish the codes of my personal project. One never stops learning, so
now I am studying high dimensional time series analysis and non-linear dynamic systems.

Any feedback is welcome!
